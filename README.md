## Problem Description and Overview:
Many elderly people in Pakistan go about their daily lives unsupervised.  They may not have a family member or a caregiver who can always tend to them.
They frequently have trouble keeping a regular daily schedule, monitoring their health, and taking their medications as prescribed. 
They may miss appointments or may forget which medicine or supplement they were supposed to take after a particular meal.
This increases the risk of unmanaged symptoms and health issues that could very well have been avoided.   

**What makes it interesting:**  
Our application is just like a personal assistant for the old people, some interesting features include; tracking medication schedules, receiving daily health status reports and generating weekly summaries on its basis,
and keeping track of appointments.
