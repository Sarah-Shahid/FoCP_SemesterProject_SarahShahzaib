## Problem Description and Overview:
Many elderly people in Pakistan go about their daily lives unsupervised.  They may not have a family member or a caregiver who can always tend to them.
They frequently have trouble keeping a regular daily schedule, monitoring their health, and taking their medications as prescribed. 
They may miss appointments or may forget which medicine or supplement they were supposed to take after a particular meal.
This increases the risk of unmanaged symptoms and health issues that could very well have been avoided.   

**What makes it interesting:**  
Our application is just like a personal assistant for the old people, some interesting features include; tracking medication schedules, receiving daily health status reports and generating weekly summaries on its basis,
and keeping track of appointments. 

# USER MANUAL:
It is an applcation, that has been designed for the elderly people to help them keep track of their medical conditions. Catering to their needs, we have added the following main modules.
- Medicine Reminders
- Health Tracker
- Mood and Journal
- Islamic Content
- Daily Routine
- Emergency Contacts
- Incident Log
- Simple Games
- Symptom Checker
- Caregiver Mode
  
1. Open the application and make a profile if you are a new user.
2. After the setup of your profile, which can be changed anytime, you are free to use the application.
3. The 2nd option on the menu takes you to a page where you can deal with your medicines. It will further show 5 options. To add a new medidine, go to option 1 and enter the medicine info which will then be saved. Make sure to enter the necessary detail.
4. To view all medicines that you've added, click on "view medicines" option from the medicine menu.
5. Go to option 4 from the medicine reminder page "Mark as Taken" to check it, do it on the application as soon as u take your medicine for accurate tracking.
6. Go to the last option "Today's Adherence Report" to check your medicine report and make sure you have taken all the medicines for the day.
7. The "Health Tracker" option in the main menu allows you to record your daily health status, be sure to monitor it closely and enter your heart rate, sugar level and blood pressure regularly.
8. The further options in the "health menu" allow you to view all your previous readings with the dates they were recorded, and see the averages for the current week so you can take any necessary measures.
9. The "Mood and Journal" option from the main menu will allow you to record your daily mood status (using a simple 1-5 scale) and then show the trend for the current week.
10. It further has an option to display the last 7 entries which can be useful to track physical changes aswell.
11. Go to the "Islamic Content" option from the main menu for daily motivation, it allows you to choose from the verses of the Qura'an or duas, and also has reminds you about the daily 5 prayers.
12. The "Incident Log" option from the main menu allows you to save all your incidents into the application with their respective dates so that you or your caregiver can go back to them when needed. This data is can also be shared with your doctor during your weekly check-ups.
13. The "Simple Games" option from the menu is for you to challenge yourself and have some fun at the same time.
14.  Go to the "Sympton Checker" option from the main menu, it has several options that describe the common minor conditions the elderly might face. Check all those you're feeling, and it will give you a short analysis and a suggestion to cope with it.
15.  The "Emergency Contacts" option will save all those contacts you always would want to have on you, enter your childrens or siblings or caregivers numbers, basically anyone whom you'd want to contact incase of an emergency.
16.  The "Caregiver Mode" is specifically for your caregiver. Using a password, it gives them access to all of your medical data and all summaries and reports. Incase you ever forget, they can ensure you are taking all you medicines on time, and your basic health readings are all normal.   

## Usage of AI and Reflection:
- Used AI to learn about reading and writing into files using the ifstream and ofstream libraries.
- Used GPT to brainstorm ideas for the project.
- It was used to learn the syntax for reading and writing into files, how to write into an empty file and how to append.
- Claude was used to help us in making a function that would give the current date and time, which had to be used whenever the user open the application.
- ChatGPTtaught us how to use getline and cin effectively so that no user input was lost.


## Future Improvements:  
- The application could be redesigned using classes and objects instead of only structs. Separate classes could be created for: (1)User (2)Medicine (3)Health Records etc. This would improve code organization, readability, and scalability.
- Instead of manual checking for the medicine adherence, the system could use system time to automatically trigger reminders. This would make the reminder system more practical and closer to a real diital assistant.
- A better version of this application would be able to support multiple users, each having their own separate profiles on the app. This would make it more suitable for families.
- This application could be integrated with smartwatches or blood pressure monitors, such devices can colect data on their own which would reduce errors in data due to manual input.
- The security could be improved using password authentication so that the users sensitive health data is protected.
